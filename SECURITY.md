# Security Best Practices

This document outlines the security measures and best practices for the Tool Management System.

## Environment Variables

Sensitive configuration is managed through environment variables. Never commit actual credentials to version control.

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Copy .env.example to .env and fill in the values
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit the `.env` file with your actual credentials.

## Secrets Management

- Never commit `.env` files
- Never commit actual credentials in configuration files
- Use environment variables for all sensitive information
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Follow the principle of least privilege for all service accounts

## JWT Security

- JWT tokens have a default expiration of 24 hours
- Always use HTTPS in production
- Store JWTs securely (HttpOnly cookies recommended)
- Implement proper token refresh mechanisms

## Database Security

- Use strong, unique passwords for database users
- Limit database access to only necessary IPs
- Regularly backup your database
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest

## AWS Security

- Use IAM roles with least privilege
- Rotate access keys regularly
- Enable MFA for root and IAM users
- Use S3 bucket policies to restrict access

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover any security vulnerabilities, please report them to the project maintainers immediately.
